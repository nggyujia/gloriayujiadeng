## Introduction
What is love? Love can be amazing, enjoyable, joyful; love can also be depressing, devastating, harmful. Undoubtedly, romantic relationships are complicated and perplexing. For years, researchers have spent effort attempting to figure out what makes people fall in love. People might have found their significant others in school, work, or other social situations. Speed dating is among one of the rising ways for people searching for a romantic relationship. When people make decisions on whether they would want to see a person again, their preferences indicate what they consider as important when picking a potentially long-term partner, and therefore analyzing choices of participants in speeding dating occasions is helpful in researching about long-term relationship. This project aims to explore and explain what attribute people are looking for in a date, and can provide some insights for those interested in this topic.

## The Data
The [data](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/) is from Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar's speed-dating experiment from 2002-2004 conducted at the Columbia University. The participants of the speed-dating events would have a four-minute date with other opposite-gender participants, and at the end of the meetings, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire, including if they would like to see the person again, and also rating their date’s six Attribute:

*   Attractiveness
*   Sincerity
*   Intelligence
*   Fun
*   Ambition
*   Shared Interests

Participants were also asked to give ratings on what they look for in the opposite gender, what they think their opposite gender are looking for, what they think their fellow men/women are looking for, how do they like each partner overall, and how probably they think the partner would decide to see them again. Demographic information are also included, such as gender and age. There are 8378 observations with 195 columns.

#### Preference Data
Prior to the event, people were asked to fill out a survey including questions about their preferences, and asked to distribute 100 points among the six Attribute. Overall, people want attractive partners the most, followed by intelligent, sincere, fun, sharing the same interests, and ambitious on average (see Figure 1).

Both men and women perceive attractiveness the most important in the opposite gender. Fun is also important an attribute they look for. On average, both genders seem to have similar expectations of their potential partners, except that compared to women, men seemed to value ambitiousness much less (see Figure 2).

#### Decision Data
Among the 8378 meetings, 4860 decisions given are “no” and 3518 decisions given are “yes”. Women seem to be more picky as they gave 55% of the "no" decision and 43% of the "yes" decision.

Compared to the people that the participants would not want to see again, most participants rated the people they want to see again higher on the six attributes, especially attractiveness (see Figure 3.1).

        legend.position = "top")
print(boxactuald)
```
*Figure 3.1. boxplots showing the distribution of the rating of the 6 attributes by decision. 0 = No, 1 = Yes.

Women rated the people they like higher on sincerity and intelligence compared to men, matching the expectations. However, ambitiousness was rated about the same in people that they want to see again and do not want to see again, while men rated the women they want to see again higher than the women they do not want to see again (see Figure 3.2).
