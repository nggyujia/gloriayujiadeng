<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Speed dating is among one of the rising ways for people searching for a romantic relationship. When people make decisions on whether they would want to see a person again, their preferences indicate what they consider as important when picking a potentially long-term partner. This project aims to explore and explain what attribute people are looking for in a date, and can provide some insights for the prolonged interest in understanding love.</p>

<div id="the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/">data</a> is from Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar’s speed-dating experiment from 2002-2004 conducted at the Columbia University. The participants of the speed-dating events had a four-minute date with other opposite-gender participants, and at the end of the meetings, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire, including if they would like to see the person again, and also rating their date’s six attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attractiveness</li>
<li>Sincerity</li>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<li>Fun</li>
<li>Ambition</li>
<li>Shared Interests</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants were also asked to give ratings on what they look for in the opposite gender, how do they like each partner overall, and how probably they think the partner would decide to see them again. Demographic information are also included, such as gender and age. There are 8378 observations with 195 columns.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<div id="preference-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Preference Data</h4>
<p>Prior to the event, people were asked to fill out a survey including questions about their preferences, and asked to distribute 100 points among the six Attribute. Overall, people want attractive partners the most, followed by intelligent, sincere, fun, sharing the same interests, and ambitious on average (see Figure 1).</p>

Top: stacked bar graphs showing the average rating of the 6 attributes in 100 points. Bottom: boxplots showing the distribution of the rating of the 6 attributes </em></p>
<p>Both men and women perceive attractiveness the most important in the opposite gender. Fun is also important an attribute they look for. On average, both genders seem to have similar expectations of their potential partners, except that compared to women, men seemed to value ambitiousness much less (see Figure 2).</p>

<div id="decision-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Decision Data</h4>
<p>Among the 8378 meetings, 4860 decisions given are “no” and 3518 decisions given are “yes”. Women seem to be more picky as they gave 55% of the “no” decision and 43% of the “yes” decision.</p>
<p>Compared to the people that the participants would not want to see again, most participants rated the people they want to see again higher on the six attributes, especially attractiveness (see Figure 3.1). <img src="/portfolio/2019-09-15-what-do-people-look-for-in-someone-to-date_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /> <em>Figure 3.1. boxplots showing the distribution of the rating of the 6 attributes by decision. 0 = No, 1 = Yes. </em></p>
<p>Women rated the people they like higher on sincerity and intelligence compared to men, matching the expectations. However, ambitiousness was rated about the same in people that they want to see again and do not want to see again, while men rated the women they want to see again higher than the women they do not want to see again (see Figure 3.2). <img src="/portfolio/2019-09-15-what-do-people-look-for-in-someone-to-date_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /> <em>Figure 3.2. Top: boxplots showing the distribution of males’ rating of the 6 attributes given to female participants by decision. Bottom: boxplots showing the distribution of females’ rating of the 6 attributes given to male participants by decision. </em></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, if people like the partner in general, they would like to meet them again. It also shows that people’s decisions seem to depend on how they think about how others view them. If they think the partner has a high probability of giving them a “yes” decision, they would give the partner a “yes” decision as well (see Figure 4 below). <img src="/portfolio/2019-09-15-what-do-people-look-for-in-someone-to-date_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /> <em>Figure 4.

<h2>Model Fitting</h2>
<p>Univariate logistic regressions are fitted on each attribute, and multivariate logistic regressions are fitted with all 6 attributes as regressors, as well as gender, prob, and like. All models predict attractiveness as the most influential attribute in people’s decisions. Surprisingly, the analyses show that when a person is rated the same on other attributes, people will tend not to want to see a more sincere person again, and the same for a more ambitious person. It also shows that men are more likely to give “yes” decision than women. People’s decisions also depend significantly on their perception on others view. While the ratings for the other attributes remain the same, if they think the person is more likely to like them, they are also prone to give this person a “yes” decision. Among the four attributes with positive impact (i.e., the higher the rating of the attribute, the more likely the person will decide to see the partner again), the most influential one (with the biggest coefficient estimate) is attractiveness, followed by shared interest, fun, and intelligence.</p>

<p>Two more models are fitted with the gender variable removed on the female and the male subsets of the data. Still, attractiveness is the most influential attribute for both males and females, but males do value it more. While other ratings remain the same, both female and male tend to give a person “no” if they rate the person more sincere or more ambitious. Another obvious difference between females and males’ decisions is how they view intelligence. While other ratings remain constant, a female is more likely to give a more intelligent person a “yes” decision, but a male is less likely to do so.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Without doubt, attractiveness is the most important attribute people look for. On average, people expect themselves to like attractive people at the first place, then in order they would consider intelligence, fun, sincerity, shared interests, and ambitiousness. People’s expectations seem to match their decisions on average, with men valuing sincerity, intelligence, ambitiousness and shared interested less compared to women both in their own expectations and actual decisions. In the process of making actual decisions, people also consider how much they like the person overall, and how much they think the person would also give them a “yes” decision. The most important attribute people look for when making actual decisions is attractiveness, followed by fun and shared interest. Even though each attribute is higher on average for those individuals who were given a “yes”, analysis shows that if all other attributes rating remain constant, a more sincere person will be favored less, and the same for a more ambitious person. Men also seem less picky, who are more likely to give “yes”, but they value attractiveness more, and they care more about how probably women will give them “yes” more than women do. A theory why sincerity and ambitiousness are presented as desirable traits individually but not so much when taking into account the other attributes is that people might find someone low on the attractiveness scale, so they want to compensate by giving a high rating on sincerity and ambitiousness.</p>
<p>In the future, topics on relationship will continue to be discussed. With the advancement of technologies, physical attractiveness could be easily altered, but other attributes could not be changed as easily. After many researches on what people look for in their partners, it would be interesting to discover whether there are any changes as time goes by.</p>
