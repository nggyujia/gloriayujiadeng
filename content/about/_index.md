title: About me
---

We usually categorize people into two types: a number person, or a non-number person. If you are in STEM, you are usually the first type; if you are an in art, you are usually the latter. We also know that there is a third type: both good at numbers and enjoy art. But this still separates the number tasks from the art. What about a forth type, those who enjoy number tasks as art? 

I started my career as a data analyst recently, and I enjoy exploring all kinds of things about data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more importantly translating numbers to easily understandable terms for all kinds of audience. Every step involved is also a form of art that requires elements of design and creativity. I find joy generating graphs and plots and finding the right colors and putting them at the right positions that empower the stories behind the data, developing models and twisting the parameters to discover underlying relationship or making inferences and predictions, and discovering patterns and novelties and putting together the findings to present. Aside from work, I do photography, play table tennis, make documentaries, and explore new things. 

I watched the Netflix documentary The Great Hack recently and was saddened by that nowadays data are used in ways that are going out of control and against people in their everyday life, instead of helping build a better world for human beings, other animals, and our environment. Throughout continuous learning and error and trials and improvements, I am working towards utilizing data to contribute to a more balanced earth.
