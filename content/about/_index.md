title: About me
---

I started my career as a data analyst recently, and I am still exploring all kinds of things about data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more importantly translating numbers to easily understandable terms for all kinds of audience. I enjoy generating graphs and plots that empower the stories behind the data, developing models to discover underlying relationship or making inferences and predictions, and discovering patterns and novelties throughout the process. 

I watched the Netflix documentary The Great Hack recently and was saddened by that nowadays data are used in ways that are going out of control and against people in their everyday life, instead of to help build a better world for human beings, other animals, and our environment. Throughout continuous learning and error and trials and improvements, I am working towards someone who will be able to utilize data to contribute to a more peaceful and more sustainable earth.

Aside from work, there are many things that I wish I could have learned while I was in college. Photography, table tennis, filmmaking, animation, etc. As we all are trying to make sense of the chaos in our lives, I do not know what the purpose is of trying to learn about all these different kinds of stuff. Maybe as Tim Ferriss mentioned in his book The 4-Hour Workweek, the ultimate purpose of making money and saving and living a "good" life, is to avoid boredom and find excitement (not happiness).
